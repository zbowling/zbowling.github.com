I've started blogging again. First thing I need to get off my chest is GitHub and the problems with it's approach to forking.

Turned out to be a lot longer of a post than I intended. First, I had to build the blog engine first (using a fork of Jekyll) and then build at the page templates. I ended up using a combination of HTML5 boilerplate and Twitter Bootstrap. It turned out pretty nice in the end.
