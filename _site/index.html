        <p>Github is amazing. We use it at <a href='http://www.seatme.com/'>SeatMe</a> to work on code both <a href='http://github.com/SeatMe/'>publicly</a> and privately. I use it for all my hackathon projects and personal code.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s wonderful&#8230; except for one flaw.</p>

<h3 id='forking_in_git_without_github'>Forking in git (without GitHub)</h3>

<p>One the best features of git (and also mercurial/hg) is it&#8217;s almost painless to clone/fork, make changes and continue to merge in code from other forks as you develop. Git also makes it nearly painless to share your changes and for others to merge your changes in back in. This is why it&#8217;s called a <em>distributed</em> source control.</p>

<p>Before git and mercurial, merging was a nightmare in most monolithic source control systems and something that was to be avoided. The only real solution was have everyone work in one repo and work on a single version at a time which doesn&#8217;t scale.</p>

<p>Even though git makes it easy to fork code and share changes, you can end up with a lot of good code lurking around that never makes its way back upstream or into the hands of others who could use your changes. If I fork and fix a bug that is useful to others, it can be a lot of effort on my part to share my changes. It&#8217;s advantageous for me to get my code back upstream so that I don&#8217;t have continue to support the changes I made, nor do I have to have to worry about potential conflicts when an upstream codebase I follow makes changes later.</p>

<p>While git makes it easier to share, it&#8217;s still a lot of work to actually get the word about your changes. Depending on the project, the options you have very. You might have post a bug report with a patch, send an email out to the other developers, post your own fork up somewhere, etc. It&#8217;s all a little hit or miss if anyone will see it and it&#8217;s often more trouble than it&#8217;s worth.</p>

<h3 id='github_gives_forks_visibility'>GitHub gives forks visibility</h3>

<p>Github does an amazing job of solving this problem. It gives forks a centralized hub to find other forks and increases code visibility. In a way, it creates a real social community of code.</p>

<p>This is why I love GitHub so much. Their tools give me a unique value that I can&#8217;t get anywhere else. It&#8217;s not like SourceForge or another project host since it provides real value and that couldn&#8217;t provide on my own by just by getting my own server. It&#8217;s the community that makes it valuable.</p>

<p>There is still plenty of room for improvement around forking on GitHub though.</p>
